# Erato

Erato is a headless content management system (CMS) built for musicians, labels and publishers, with other arts in mind. It enables you to manage your music catalogue, artists (bios, photos, videos, etc.), events, press releases, and more.
At its core, Erato is simply a blogging software but it has a lot of extras that are incredibly useful to manage metadata, link aggregation and promotion.
You will also be able to integrate Erato with your e-commerce platform like Shopify (more planned). with the ability to offload the CMS to Shopify's first-party blogging system for example.
